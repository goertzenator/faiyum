*Urbanize Faiyum by building a new settlement.*

Place 1 settlement on any **crocodile-free** resource space of your
choice. That space is now **developed**. Any worker present remains
on this space. A gap of at least 1 space must be present between two
settlements, but settlements on opposite spaces of the channel are
okay since the channel separates these spaces.
Pay 1 wheat, 1 grape, and 1 stone. Gain 3 reputation and $3. You can gain 1 extra
reputation as explained under {{cut(txt="S - TWO ROADS.")}}

**Example:**: Hedwig plays **S - SETTLEMENT** and places a settlement on the
crocodile-free wheat space {{circle(txt="1.")}}. She pays 1 wheat, 1 grape and 1 stone, then gains 3 reputation and $3. The next settlement could be placed on the {{check()}} spaces as they are the necessary distance from the existing settlements. The {{x()}} space is not crocodile-free, so Hedwig could not place a settlement there.
adjacent to the new settlement cannot be chosen, even though it is crocodile-free.
