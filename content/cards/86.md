*The soldiers of the pharaoh need to parade through Faiyum.*

Move 1 upright worker (You cannot choose a prone worker from {{cut(txt="60 - GEM MINERS.")}}) from a settlement to 1-3 other settlements along connected roads. The destination must not have a worker. Then, remove that worker.

For moving to one settlement, pay $2, then gain 4 reputation; for moving to two settlements, pay $4, then gain 5 reputation; for moving to three settlements, pay $6, then gain 6 reputation.

**Example:** Nicole plays **86 - PARADE**. She moves the worker from the
settlement next to the lake up to the first settlement {{circle(txt="1.")}} ,
down to the settlement next to the pyramid {{circle(txt="2.")}}, and then to
the settlement on the grape space {{circle(txt="3.")}}. Nicole pays $6 then
gains 6 reputation. Finally, she removes the worker {{circle(txt="4.")}}. She
could not stop at the second settlement as a worker is on that space.
