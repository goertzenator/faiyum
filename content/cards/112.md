*The pharaoh visits Faiyum.*

Place 1 worker upright on any town.

For the town of the pharaoh and each settlement, town, and building site directly connected to the pharaoh’s town by roads and bridges (a workshop on a space between connected settlements and/or building sites does not interrupt the direct connection), gain the following reputation: 2 reputation per town, 1 reputation per settlement that is not a town, and 1 reputation for each building block on the building sites.

**Example:** Hedwig plays **112 - PHARAOH**. She places a worker on the town
{{circle(txt="1.")}}, then gains 9 reputation (5 reputation for the {{check()}}
pharaoh’s town as well as the second {{check()}} town and settlement, and 4
reputation for the 4 building blocks on the {{check()}}pyramid, all directly
connected to it). If she chose the other town {{circle(txt="2.")}}, she would
gain only 5 reputation for the directly connected {{x()}} towns and settlement.
