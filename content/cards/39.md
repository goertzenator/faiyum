*Take back any card.*

**Onetime effect:** Take any one card in your hand, the moment it is removed from the game. You can use this effect out of sequence during a turn of another player! Simply choose a card, that is removed during a "Carry out administration" action or after using a onetime effect.

*“Yes, Ronald, you can even use one of your REPUTATION cards during the game and take it back in your hand with this effect.”*
