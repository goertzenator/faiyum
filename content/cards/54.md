*To cope with demand, increase the size of the workshops.*

Place 1 expansion next to any workshop without an expansion.
Any worker present remains on this space. Regarding other card
actions, this space is still considered to be a workshop.

Pay 1 resource *of your choice* (grape, stone, wheat, or fish). Gain 3
reputation.

**Example:** Nicole plays **54 - EXPANSION**. She places the expansion on the grape
workshop {{circle(txt="1.")}}, pays 1 stone, then gains 3 reputation.

Next, Angelika plays **56 - ASSISTANT**. She places a worker on the wheat
workshop {{circle(txt="2.")}} and gains 3 wheat. She could have chosen the
grape workshop to gain 3 grapes instead.
