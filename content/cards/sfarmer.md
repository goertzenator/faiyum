*Send out a farmer to gain one of the three basic types of resources.*

Place 1 worker upright on any **undeveloped** resource space **adjacent to** another worker that is on any space, whether developed or undeveloped. If no other workers are on the game board, you have free choice of any undeveloped resource space on either peninsula.

Depending on the chosen resource space, gain 1 **matching resource** (grape, stone, or wheat).

{{croc()}} If a crocodile is on this space, remove it from the game and gain $1.

**Example:** Angelika plays **S - FARMER**. She places the worker on the grape space adjacent to the other worker {{circle(txt="1.")}} and removes the crocodile from the game {{circle(txt="2.")}} Angelika gains 1 grape and $1. Alternatively, Angelika could choose the {{check()}} spaces (without getting $1 for a crocodile-free space), but could not choose the {{x()}} space as it is not adjacent (other side of the channel).

If she played **6 - SENIOR FARMER**, Angelika would gain 2 grapes and $1.
