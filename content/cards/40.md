*Thanks to a growing population, a settlement becomes a town.*

Place 1 town on any settlement, which is not a town. Any worker
present remains on this space. For other card actions, this space
is now considered to be both a settlement and a town.

Pay 1 wheat, 1 grape, and 1 stone. Gain 5 reputation and $2.
