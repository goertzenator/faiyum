**Example:** Hedwig plays **8 - HERMIT**. She chooses the grape space on the
small peninsula {{circle(txt="1.")}} that is on the opposite site of the
channel from one of the settlements. Hedwig removes a crocodile
{{circle(txt="2.")}}, and gains 2 reputation and $1. While this region of the
game board has become somewhat developed, she could choose any of the
undeveloped spaces, which are mostly at the edges of the region.
