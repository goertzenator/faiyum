*Send out a gardener to gain a valuable rose.*

Place 1 worker upright on any **undeveloped** space **adjacent to** the
channel. *“YES, Ronald, no need for an adjacent worker!”*

Gain 1 rose. Anytime you pay resources, you can replace any needed
resource with a rose.

{{croc()}} Remove a crocodile as explained under {{cut(txt="S - FARMER.")}}

**Example:** Nicole plays **S - TWO ROADS**. She places two roads on two pairs of
crocodile-free spaces. The first connects the settlement with the grape space {{circle(txt="1.")}},
and the second connects the building site with the settlement {{circle(txt="2.")}}. Nicole pays
1 wheat and 1 grape, then gains 3 reputation plus 1 extra reputation for the
first direct connection between the building site and the settlement.

Next, Angelika plays **2 - GARDENER**. She chooses one of the {{check()}}
spaces adjacent to the channel as the {{x()}} spaces are already developed or
occupied by another worker. Angelika gains 1 rose and (if she removes a
crocodile) $1.
