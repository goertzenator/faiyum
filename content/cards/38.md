*Connecting the two peninsulas brings great reputation.*

Place 1 bridge **connecting** two **crocodile-free** spaces on
opposite sides of the channel. Any workers present remain
there. These spaces are now **developed**. (They are connected
by the bridge, but still not adjacent.) Follow all placement rules as
explained under {{cut(txt="S - TWO ROADS.")}}

Pay 2 resources **of your choice** (grape, stone, or wheat) to gain 4
reputation. You can choose the same or different resources. If you directly
connect a settlement and/or building site with another settlement and/or
building site for the first time, gain 1 extra reputation.

**Example:** Nicole plays **38 - BRIDGE**. She places a bridge from the
settlement across the channel {{circle(txt="1.")}}. She pays 1 wheat and 1
grape, then gains 4 reputation. She could have chosen the {{check()}} places
(even connecting the two settlements at the top) but could not choose the
{{x()}} place as roads and bridges cannot branch on resource spaces.
