*A journeying farmer gains resources on their way.*

Move 1 upright worker up to 2 **adjacent** resource spaces or move 2 workers each
1 **adjacent** resource space. You can choose any workers on the game board
(except prone workers from {{cut(txt="60 - GEM MINERS")}}), even workers
standing on settlements or building sites.

Depending on the chosen spaces, gain 1 each of the matching resources (grape,
stone, or wheat).

{{croc()}} Remove up to 2 crocodiles as explained under {{cut(txt="S - FARMER.")}}

**Example:** Hedwig plays **26 - MIGRANT FARMER**. She moves the worker from
the settlement to the adjacent grape space {{circle(txt="1.")}} and the worker
from space {{circle(txt="1.")}}, removing both crocodiles along the way. Hedwig
gains 1 grape, 1 wheat, and $2.
