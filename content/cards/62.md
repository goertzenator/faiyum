*Some chosen workers aspire to a clerical life.*

Remove 1-3 upright workers from any spaces. You cannot
choose prone workers from {{cut(txt="60 - GEM MINERS.")}}

Gain $2 per removed worker.

**Example:** Hedwig plays **60 - GEM MINERS**. She uses the first option and
lays down 3 workers by paying $3 {{circle(txt="1.")}}. These workers will
remain on these spaces until Hedwig plays **GEM MINERS** again and chooses to
remove all prone workers.

Next, Nicole plays **62 - NOVICES**. She cannot choose
the prone workers and instead removes 3 standing workers of her choice
{{circle(txt="2.")}}, then gains $6.
