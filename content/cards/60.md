*Digging for gems can be a profitable endeavor.*

Choose one option:
- Lay down 1-5 upright workers on any spaces. Pay $1 per worker. These prone workers can be removed only by playing the {{cut(txt="GEM MINERS")}} card again and choosing the second option.
- Remove all prone workers from the game board. Gain $3 per removed
worker.

**Example:** Hedwig plays **60 - GEM MINERS**. She uses the first option and
lays down 3 workers by paying $3 {{circle(txt="1.")}}. These workers will
remain on these spaces until Hedwig plays **GEM MINERS** again and chooses to
remove all prone workers.

Next, Nicole plays **62 - NOVICES**. She cannot choose
the prone workers and instead removes 3 standing workers of her choice
{{circle(txt="2.")}}, then gains $6.
