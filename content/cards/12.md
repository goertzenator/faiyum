*Making a sacrifice is rewarded by the gods.*

Place 1 building block on any building site. Any worker present remains there.
Each building site has a limit for building blocks as shown via the shape of
the structure (an obelisk, a colossus, and two pyramids) and the number next to
it.

Remove 1 of your cards from the game. Gain 1 reputation and $3. You can
choose any card from your hand, your discard stack, or even this card. When
removing a card from the discard stack, do not change the order of the
remaining cards

*Example:* Nicole plays **12 - SACRIFICE** and places a building block on the
obelisk building site {{circle(txt="1.")}}, then she removes one of her **S -
FARMER** cards from the game, taking it out of her discard stack without
changing that stack‘s order.

Next, Angelika plays **14 - WHEAT SUPPLIER**. She places a worker on the
settlement and gains 2 wheat.

“YES, Ronald, the wheat supplier does not care about the type of resource
space of the settlement. Angelika could have chosen the other empty
settlement, too, to gain wheat.”
