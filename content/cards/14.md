*Example:* Nicole plays **12 - SACRIFICE** and places a building block on the
obelisk building site {{circle(txt="1.")}}, then she removes one of her **S -
FARMER** cards from the game, taking it out of her discard stack without
changing that stack‘s order.

Next, Angelika plays **14 - WHEAT SUPPLIER**. She places a worker on the
settlement and gains 2 wheat.

“YES, Ronald, the wheat supplier does not care about the type of resource
space of the settlement. Angelika could have chosen the other empty
settlement, too, to gain wheat.”
