*With the help of a thief, you gain better abilities.*

Take 1 of the 4 cards from the current market for free. Place the stolen card
on your discard stack, then place {{cut(txt="THIEF")}} on top of it. If a
discount token is on the chosen card, place it above the card market. Draw 1
card from the draw pile and place it in the proper numerical order in the card
market.
