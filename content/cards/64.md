**Example:** Angelika plays **64 - BAZAAR**. She chooses the card **52 -
ORDER** {{circle(txt="1.")}} and takes it into her hand. Angelika pays $1, then
places the discount token above the card market {{circle(txt="2.")}} (it will
be used again in the next administration action taken by any player). Then, she
draws 1 card from the draw pile and places it into the card market.
