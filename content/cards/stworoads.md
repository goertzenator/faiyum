*Connecting places helps to urbanize Faiyum.*

Place 2 roads, each of which must **connect** two adjacent **crocodile-free**
spaces. These spaces are now **developed**. Any workers present remain on these
spaces. You can place the two roads connected to one another or at different
places on the game board. A road either starts in a settlement or building
site, or continues another road or bridge (see {{cut(txt="38 - BRIDGE")}} and
{{cut(txt="118 - GRAND BRIDGE")}}), including the road that begins the game on
the dam. Roads can branch out only on settlements and building sites. Thus, you
cannot build a junction on a resource space.

Pay 2 resources, one per road. The resource must **match** one of the resource
spaces (grape, stone, or wheat) connected by that particular road. Gain 3
reputation. If a road finishes the first direct connection of two settlements,
two building sites, or a settlement and building site, gain 1 extra reputation
(up to 2 extra reputation for two separate first connections built with both
roads). You also gain this extra reputation when you place a new settlement on
a space already connected by roads to another settlement or building site.

**Example:** Nicole plays **S - TWO ROADS**. She places two roads on two pairs of
crocodile-free spaces. The first connects the settlement with the grape space {{circle(txt="1.")}},
and the second connects the building site with the settlement {{circle(txt="2.")}}. Nicole pays
1 wheat and 1 grape, then gains 3 reputation plus 1 extra reputation for the
first direct connection between the building site and the settlement.

Next, Angelika plays **2 - GARDENER**. She chooses one of the {{check()}}
spaces adjacent to the channel as the {{x()}} spaces are already developed or
occupied by another worker. Angelika gains 1 rose and (if she removes a
crocodile) $1.
