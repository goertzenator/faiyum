**Example:** Hedwig plays **44 - FARM**. She places 1 workshop on the wheat
space developed by the bridge {{circle(txt="1.")}}. Hedwig pays 1 grape and 1
stone, then gains 3 reputation and 3 wheat.

If she had played **46 - VINEYARD** instead, she could place a workshop on one of
the three {{check()}} spaces connected by roads.
