*A senior farmer guarantees a better crop.*

Place 1 worker upright on any **undeveloped** resource space **adjacent to** another worker that is on any space, whether developed or undeveloped. If no other workers are on the game board, you have free choice of any undeveloped resource space on either peninsula.


Depending on the chosen space, gain 2 **matching** resources (grape,
stone, or wheat).
